# Attachment Support Implementation

## Problem
When Odoo agents send attachments through the live chat, the chat widget only displays the agent name with a blank message instead of showing the attachment.

## Solution
Added comprehensive attachment support to the AI middleware system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `odoo_client.py`
- **Added `attachment_ids` field** to the message search query in `start_longpolling_listener()`
- **Created `_get_attachments_sync()` method** to fetch attachment details from Odoo
- **Enhanced message processing** to include attachment information in the callback data
- **Added debugging logs** to track attachment processing

### 2. Updated `widget.js`
- **Enhanced `addMessage()` function** to accept and display attachments
- **Added file type icons** with `getFileIcon()` function for different MIME types
- **Added file size formatting** with `formatFileSize()` function
- **Created attachment UI elements** with download links
- **Added CSS styling** for attachment display
- **Enhanced WebSocket message handling** to process attachment data
- **Added console logging** for debugging

### 3. Updated `websocket_manager.py`
- **Maintained existing message flow** (no changes needed as it passes through the data)

## Features Added

### Attachment Display
- **File icons** based on MIME type (📄 for PDFs, 🖼️ for images, etc.)
- **File names** with proper truncation
- **File sizes** in human-readable format (KB, MB, GB)
- **Download buttons** that open files in new tabs
- **Responsive design** that works on mobile and desktop

### Supported File Types
- Images (🖼️)
- Videos (🎥)
- Audio files (🎵)
- PDFs (📄)
- Word documents (📝)
- Excel spreadsheets (📊)
- PowerPoint presentations (📋)
- Archives/ZIP files (📦)
- Generic files (📎)

### UI Improvements
- **Hover effects** on attachment items and download buttons
- **Proper spacing** and alignment
- **Color coordination** with existing message styling
- **Mobile-responsive** attachment display

## Testing

### Test File Created
- `test_attachments.html` - Simple test page to verify functionality

### How to Test
1. Start the AI middleware server
2. Open the test page or any page with the widget
3. Start a chat conversation
4. Trigger handoff to Odoo agent
5. Have the agent send a file attachment
6. Verify the attachment appears with:
   - Correct file icon
   - File name
   - File size
   - Working download link

### Debugging
- Console logs show WebSocket message data
- Server logs show attachment processing details
- Error handling with stack traces for troubleshooting

## Technical Details

### Attachment Data Flow
1. **Odoo agent sends message** with attachment
2. **Odoo stores attachment** in `ir.attachment` model
3. **Message includes `attachment_ids`** field
4. **Middleware fetches attachment details** using Odoo API
5. **WebSocket sends enriched message** with attachment data
6. **Widget displays attachment** with download link

### Download URL Format
```
{odoo_url}/web/content/{attachment_id}?download=true
```

### Attachment Data Structure
```javascript
{
  id: 123,
  name: "document.pdf",
  mimetype: "application/pdf",
  size: 1024000,
  download_url: "https://odoo.example.com/web/content/123?download=true"
}
```

## Minimal Code Changes
The implementation follows the requirement for minimal code changes:
- **Only essential modifications** to existing functions
- **No breaking changes** to existing functionality
- **Backward compatible** - works with or without attachments
- **Clean separation** of attachment logic

## Error Handling
- **Graceful fallback** if attachment fetching fails
- **Empty attachment arrays** handled properly
- **Network errors** logged but don't break chat functionality
- **Invalid attachment data** filtered out safely
